    body: "When humans where still primates they had light skin covered by lot’s of long hair. This was because the hair protected them from the ultraviolet radiation constantly bearing down on them.",

  {
    title: "Humans Lose Their Hair",
    body: "When humans evolved from primates they lost much of the hair that surrounded their bodies, this was because with less body hair they could stay cooler under the heat of the sun. The side effect of this though was they now had no protection against ultraviolet radiation.",

    title: "Skin Darkens",
    body: "It is popularly believed that UV radiation causing skin cancer is what drove the evolution of darker skin. This is untrue as skin cancer stemming from UV exposure only effects people after they can not reproduce anymore so it didn’t effect humans ability to reproduce. The real reason was that the UV radiation harmed the folate of humans, and when the folate was damaged it decreased the chances for a human to reproduce. Human skin became darker because increased amounts of melatonin(the pigment that creates a darker skin tone) protected the folate.",
  },
  {
    title: "Skin Lightens",
    body: "As some humans moved away from the equator the amount of UV radiation they where exposed to lowered. This meant that the selective pressure of UV radiation harming the folate was lessened, so less melatonin was needed to protect the folate. The lower exposure to UV radiation also had another side effect that put a selective pressure for humans skin to become lighter and that was less vitamin D was being produced so human skin had to become lower in those areas farther from the equator so that the body could absorb the correct amount of UV radiation to have enough vitamin D.",

export const why = "The evolution of human skin colour shows quite simply that skin colour has nothing to do with any human trait other how much UV radiation is absorbed or blocked from the body. This is important because it is undeniable proof that skin colour does not divide us as humans, it is just one part of our shared history."
